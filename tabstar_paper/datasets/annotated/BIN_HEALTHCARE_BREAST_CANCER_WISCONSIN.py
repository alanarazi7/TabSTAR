**Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Data Set.** Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The target feature records the prognosis (malignant or benign). [Original data available here](ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/cancer/)  

Current dataset was adapted to ARFF format from the UCI version. Sample code ID's were removed.  

! Note that there is also a related Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis) Data Set with a different set of features, better known as [wdbc](https://www.openml.org/d/1510).
